# Becoming a Liquidity Provider

#### High level description of how lending works and implications of being a liquidity provider.

Liquidity is the key to any financial instrument, and xycLoans manages its own liquidity with safety as the first and most important principle. The protocol itself doesn't manage the liquidity, but every pool has its own liquidity management which only comes from and goes to the lenders.

When you become a liquidity provider, you will be minted liquidity provider shares, which will allow you to:
- withdraw your liquidity at any time without any restrictions.
- collect and withdraw the accrued yield.
