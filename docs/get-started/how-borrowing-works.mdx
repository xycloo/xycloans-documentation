# How To Borrow

Borrowing a flash loan on xycLoans is very simple: all you need is a receiver contract, a strategy, and of course a stellar account. After reading this page, you'll learn how to borrow a flash loan on Soroban with xycLoans.

## Preparing to Borrow
Flash loans take place in a single transaction, but before we can execute that transaction we need to create and deploy a receiver contract.

We will go deeper into the functioning and the precautions needed to write a secure receiver contract in the next section. For now, you just need to know that it is the contract that contains the strategy to use the money lent by the flash loan contract. The receiver contract will be invoked by the flash loan contract after the flash loan has transferred the requested amount of tokens to it.

In fact, the borrow process works as follows:
1. invoke the flash loan borrow (through the proxy or the flash loan).
2. the flash loan transfers the requested amount to the provided receiver contract.
3. the flash loan invokes the provided receiver contract.
4. the receiver contract performs all the operations using its strategy.
5. the receiver contrat creates an allowance to re-pay the flash loan + a small interest.
6. the flash loan "claims" the allowance and transfers the interest to the vault.

### Simple Receiver Contract
As you may have guessed, the main point of the receiver contract is to expose a `execute_operation()` method that at the end of its execution has created an allowance to re-pay the debt.

Since there aren't yet any public protocols on Soroban, to showcase a borrow our receiver contract will simply create the allowance when invoked (this assumes we already have in the receiver's balance the interest of the borrowed amount):

```rust
#![no_std]
use receiver_interface::{Contract, ReceiverError};
use soroban_sdk::{contractimpl, Address, BytesN, Env, Symbol};

mod token {
    soroban_sdk::contractimport!(file = "../../soroban_token_spec.wasm");
}

mod receiver_interface {
    soroban_sdk::contractimport!(
        file =
            "../../target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/soroban_flash_loan_receiver_standard.wasm"
    );
}

pub struct FlashLoanReceiverContract;
pub struct FlashLoanReceiverContractExt;

fn compute_fee(amount: &i128) -> i128 {
    amount / 2000 // 0.05%, still TBD
}

#[contractimpl]
impl receiver_interface::Contract for FlashLoanReceiverContract {
    fn exec_op(e: Env) -> Result<(), ReceiverError> {
        let token_client = token::Client::new(
            &e,
            &e.storage()
                .get::<Symbol, BytesN<32>>(&Symbol::short("T"))
                .unwrap()
                .unwrap(),
        );

        /*
        Perform all your operations here
        */

        // Re-paying the loan + 0.05% interest
        let borrowed = e
            .storage()
            .get::<Symbol, i128>(&Symbol::short("A"))
            .unwrap()
            .unwrap();
        let total_amount = borrowed + compute_fee(&borrowed);
        token_client.incr_allow(
            &e.current_contract_address(),
            &e.storage()
                .get::<Symbol, Address>(&Symbol::short("FL"))
                .unwrap()
                .unwrap(),
            &total_amount,
        );

        Ok(())
    }
}

#[contractimpl]
impl FlashLoanReceiverContractExt {
    pub fn init(
        e: Env,
        token_id: BytesN<32>,
        fl_address: Address,
        amount: i128,
    ) -> Result<(), ReceiverError> {
        e.storage().set(&Symbol::short("T"), &token_id);
        e.storage().set(&Symbol::short("FL"), &fl_address);
        e.storage().set(&Symbol::short("A"), &amount);
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

In the above contract, we have implemented `exec_op()` to just create an allowance to the flash loan contract for the borrowed amount (which we read from a contract storage slot) + the interest, calculated with `compute_fee(amount)` (0.05% of the borrowed capital). We also have extended the contract for it to be initialized so that it can be used without hardcoding the parameters. 

:::tip Writing secure receiver contracts

The above isn't a secure receiver contract, just a proof of concept. You'll learn how to write secure and safe receiver contracts in [Writing Receiver Contracts](#). 

:::

You'll need to deploy and initialize your receiver contract. If you user the above contract you can follow these two steps below. If you don't (i.e you write your own receiver contract), we assume that you are already familiar with soroban and know how to initialize the receiver yourself. 
- Deploy the receiver contract: 
```bash
soroban contract deploy --wasm $PATH_TO_RECEIVER_WASM --source-account $SECRET_KEY --rpc-url https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org:443/soroban/rpc --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022'
```

- Initialize the receiver contract: 
```bash
RECEIVER="YOUR_RECEIVER_ID" # id of your deployed receiver contract
RECEIVER_ADDR="YOUR_RECEIVER_ADDR" # address of your deployed receiver contract (you can obtain it from the id at https://strkey-encode.xycloo.com/)

TOKEN_ID="d93f5c7bb0ebc4a9c8f727c5cebc4e41194d38257e1d0d910356b43bfc528813" # token to borrow, in our case XLM
AMOUNT=1000000000 # we are borrowing 100 XLM

soroban contract invoke --id $RECEIVER --source-account $FEES_ADDR_SECRET --rpc-url --rpc-url https://rpc-futurenet.stellar.org:443/soroban/rpc --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022' -- init --token_id $TOKEN_ID --fl_address "$FLASH_LOAN_ADDR" --amount $AMOUNT
```

# Borrowing

Now that you have set up your receiver contract you're ready to borrow a flash loan from xycLoans. Now, as you can see from the receiver contract code, there's a section (`/* Perform all your operations here */`) that is dedicated to executing profit-generating operations that will allow the receiver contract to repay the flash loan along with the small liquidity-provider fee. However, given that we don't have the possibility to make profit with such operations on Soroban just yet (hang tight, most projects are still under development, just like xycLoans!), we will need the receiver contract to already hold some balance before re-paying the loan. This already-existing receiver contract balance should not be less than the fee paid to the flash loan, so not less than 0.05% of the borrowed amount. 

Assuming we are borrowing XLM (that's what we're using in our receiver contract, take a look at the initialize invocation you just made), we will need to send some XLM to the receiver contract. We decide to send 10XLM, which in an actual production receiver contract is the profit obtained from the various trading/lending operations:

```bash
RECEIVER_ADDR="YOUR_RECEIVER_ADDR" # address of your deployed receiver contract (you can obtain it from the id at https://strkey-encode.xycloo.com/)

soroban contract invoke --id d93f5c7bb0ebc4a9c8f727c5cebc4e41194d38257e1d0d910356b43bfc528813 --source-account $SECRET_KEY --rpc-url https://future.stellar.kai.run:443/soroban/rpc --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022' -- xfer --from "$PUBLIC_KEY" --to "$RECEIVER_ADDR" --amount 100000000 # 10 XLM
```

Finally, we can borrow our flash loan by invoking the flash loan contract's `borrow` method:

```bash
RECEIVER_ADDR="YOUR_RECEIVER_ADDR" # address of your deployed receiver contract (you can obtain it from the id at https://strkey-encode.xycloo.com/)
AMOUNT=1000000000 # we are borrowing 100 XLM

soroban contract invoke --id $FLASH_LOAN --source-account $FEES_ADDR_SECRET --rpc-url https://future.stellar.kai.run:443/soroban/rpc --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022' -- borrow --receiver_id "$RECEIVER_ADDR" --amount $AMOUNT
```

That's it! You took your first successful flash loan on Soroban, if you now check your receiver contract's XLM balance, you should see it holding 9.5XLM (10XLM of profit - 0.5XLM that goes to the flash loan as fee):

```bash
RECEIVER_ADDR="YOUR_RECEIVER_ADDR" # address of your deployed receiver contract (you can obtain it from the id at https://strkey-encode.xycloo.com/)

soroban contract invoke --id d93f5c7bb0ebc4a9c8f727c5cebc4e41194d38257e1d0d910356b43bfc528813 --source-account $SECRET_KEY --rpc-url https://future.stellar.kai.run:443/soroban/rpc --network-passphrase 'Test SDF Future Network ; October 2022' -- balance --id "$RECEIVER_ADDR"

# should return 95000000 stroops as balance for $RECEIVER_ADDR
```

:::tip Profiting with flash loans

Remember that you won't need to send the 10XLM to the receiver address when borrowing a "real" flash loan, but you'll interact with other contracts in order to generaate profit. Use cases are arbitrage trading, liquidations, collateral swapping, and others.

Now that you have explored how borrowing works, you may be curious about what are some best practices for implementing a secure receiver contract. See you in the next section!
